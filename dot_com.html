       <p>In the 21st century an evolution of capitalism is taking place. A new phase of capitalism is upon us, the age of e-commerce, an age where the internet changed the way the business works.  The internet has changed the way people buy and sell.  This new age was also ushered in by a transformative technology, the world wide web and by two influential companies, amazon.com and eBay.  Amazon and eBay were creating a whole new model of commerce one based on taking the internet and harnessing the power of the great mass of individuals.
	However, this transition did not come without any problems.  With the rise of the e-commence revolution, there was also a downfall.  The explosive growth of the internet lead to many investors very eager in investing to new internet and high-tech companies.  Blinded by greed and ignorance of this new technology, a financial bubble also known as the Dot Com Bubble was created.  The Bubble started when Netscape launched its wildly successful initial public offering on the stock market then year later followed the IPOs of search engine companies such as Yahoo and a year after that Jeff Bezos took the next step in pushing the web boom in the direction of a bubble.  The Amazon IPO took place in May1997 when company was just two years old  with little revenues and no profits.  However, there was a lot of hype surrounding Amazon with Bezos calling Amazon Earthâ€™s biggest bookstore attracting a lot of investors.  Similar things happened with other companies such as Ebay whose successes sparked a wave of imitators moving to silicon valley and starting their own dot com businesses which blew up the bubble even further.

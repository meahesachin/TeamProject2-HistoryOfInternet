  <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
  <p>Internet is the defining technology of our times. It enables people and machines, from computers and wearables, and everything in between, to communicate instantaneously in a way that makes the world seem closer than ever before.</p>

      <p>Once a collection of web pages, FTP servers and email messages, it is now everywhere, pervasive in its reach and ever present, and has taken as primary means of communication and interaction not only between humans but also between humans and machines and entirely between machines as well. We already have self-driving cars, machines that seem like they can think and make decisions for themselves.</p>

      <h2>How it all began!</h2>
      <h5>No other invention has grown so quickly or has so much impact so swiftly and so widely, from emails to financial transactions</h5>

      <p>It’s a key component of our civilization and yet no one really controls it.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>This is how...</h2>


      <ul class="list-group">
      	<li class="list-group-item">Inclusion guided its development. Intended to be as open as possible where anyone could contribute or use.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Starting 1950s, idea behind Internet was envisioned by a psychologist called JCR Licklider, a professor at MIT. His idea was that computers could be linked together which would allow us to communicate better and would be beneficial in sharing of information.</li>




<li class="list-group-item">Computers would have remained standalone monoliths, if not for USSR’s launch of Sputnik in October 1957 that spurred the scientists into the idea of teamwork.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">To catchup and surpass the Soviet Union in space technology, President Eisenhower created a division at the Defense Department call Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), in charge of the space program which included Computer Science.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Establishment of NASA gave an impetus to the space race but left research into Computer Science behind.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">It moved slowly but kept making steady progress.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Leonard Kleinrock, a graduate student at MIT, began applying queuing theory to data transmission.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Demand Access and Distributed Control, an idea for effective resource sharing and shared control respectively are key principles.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Paul Baran was hired to see if a resilient network could be created which would withstand nuclear attack.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Came up with “hot potato” routing which ensures a path remains viable even if part of the network is destroyed.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Key is to break messages into small, equal sized chunks called packets which included a to and from address.
<li class="list-group-item">Packet switching research and theory matured in 1962 to show that it could be built and used for computer communication. Actual implementation, in fact, didn’t happen until 1969.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">In 1966, Bob Taylor, of ARPA, needed a separate terminal to log into each separate timeshare computers spread across the country. They didn’t talk to each other.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">He envisioned a network where one terminal could connect to all the computers that were networked together.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for building the network. Roberts had already built an experimental connection between two computers at an MIT library. </li>
<li class="list-group-item">The contract to build the network based on Roberts’ instruction was awarded to BBN. The initial plan was to network 4 computers, at UCSB, SRI, UCLA and Utah together on this network. Work began in January 69 with first delivery planned 9 months later.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">First IMP, interface message processor, arrived at UCLA in September 1969.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">All 4 sites were interconnected by end of 1969.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">By April 1971, 18 mainframes were on the ARPANet network.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Raymond Tomlinson introduced email on the network in March 1972.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">October 1972 ARPA demonstrated the computer network in Washington, DC.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">In growing the Internet, the focus was on ideas and dialogue rather than edicts and directives.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">By 1972 ARPANet had fewer than 25 sites online yet more were coming. What sparked an interest was the first International Conference on Computer Communication sponsored by ARPA.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">NSF required to be on their network to receive grant money.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">LANs and WANs emerged to connect offices and branches across buildings, campuses and institutions.
<li class="list-group-item">In 1973 Vin Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules to connect disparate networks together, called TCP/IP protocol.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Tim Berners-Lee created World Wide Web in 1980. Allowed Internet to be free and user friendly.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">In 1983, after 10 years of refinement, TCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard. This allowed the rapid evolution of the Internet, a common network of interconnected networks.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">In June 1992 Congress passed legislation taking the Internet out of the hands of the Government and into public hands. </li>
<li class="list-group-item">50 web pages on the Internet in 1992.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Mosaic web brower developed 1993 by Marc Andreesen to allow users to “browse” the Internet. Allowed the “web” to grow 341,000% shortly after.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">It is still under construction and will always be.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">The history doesn’t capture the potential of the Internet…it’s grown and reach is only limited by the human imagination and ingenuity.</li>

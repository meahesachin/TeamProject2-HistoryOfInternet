      <p>	    The web has revolutionized the way people functions but people have also changed how the web functions.  In Silicon Valley three guys are leading a web 2.0 revolution, Chad Hurley, Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson.  Rose and Adelson run a social news website called Digg, the content of which is chosen by its own user community of millions.  Hurley is the cofounder of one of the most popular websites called Youtube, an online video sharing service that was bought by Google in 2006 for 1.65 billion dollars.  Digg and Youtube offers an alternative to old-school media by offering the people news and information and other content straight from the common man and not from big corporations who holds a tight grip on what sort of information and content gets published and produced.
	How people acquire music has also changed drastically due to the web.  Originally the only way to get music was to go to a music store and buy it there.  However, with the web, people can now download straight from web sites.  One of these sites was Napster, developed by Shawn Fanning, which used to one of the most popular music sharing site.  Sites like Napster were very controversial in that they use peer-to-peer technology which allows users to share copyrighted music without paying for them which is illegal.  Napster has been said to have broken the distribution monopoly exercised by record companies as millions of people have now been used to swapping songs cutting off the middleman.
	Web 2.0 also gave birth to social networks like Friendster, Myspace and Facebook with Facebook coming out on top.  Facebook was developed by a Harvard dropout named Mark Zuckerberg.  The origins of Facebook is similar to Netscape and Google in that it came out of Silicon Valley and had the potential to fundamentally change the web.  Facebook experienced enormous growth quickly overshadowing Myspace with its 50 million active users at the time.

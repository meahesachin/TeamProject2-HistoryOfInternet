  <h1>Browser Wars!</h1>
  <p>Web Browsers are a critical part of bringing the Internet to the masses and help propel its rapid adoption. Suddenly, there was this technology that allowed you to “browse” the Internet, helping discover new worlds and ideas, where you could simply follow along, not having to know where to start or how to get around. A person could discover a website and follow the links to additional knowledge and experiences.</p>

         <p>The world wide web, an amazing and surreal universe that spawned fortunes, appended industries and changed the way much of the world works, communicates, shops and so much more. The Browser begat this revolution and it is continuing today to redefine and shape our lives for generations to come.</p>
         <p>In the beginning though, there was a battle to decide who would control the web.</p>

      <h2>Let the games begin!</h2>
       <p> Fascinated by the World Wide Web, invented in 1989, a visionary Computer Science student at University of Illinois named Marc Andreesen had a crazy idea. He imagined a future where regular people would use the web as part of their daily lives. He along with a couple of friends began to imagine a tool that would enable just that. The fruit of their labor was Mosaic, the world’s first graphical web browser. Released in the fall if 1993, it quickly spread as users realized the power of this invention. This was a moment when the Internet went from obscurity to ubiquity.
           </p><p>To be truly successful, and take on big corporations like Microsoft and IBM, Mosaic needed financial support. It came from Jim Clark. It was Jim who realized the true power of Internet and World Wide Web. He invited Marc to form a new company that would turn Mosaic into the heart of new business venture.

            </p><p>One company that was late to the game, and didn’t realize the impact a Browser would have, was Microsoft. After creating a new monopoly on the PC operating system for 2 decades, Bill Gates and Microsoft were behind in realizing the potential of this game changing technology. Bill Gates thought that the information superhighway was a tool booth that users would have to pay to get on.

            </p><p>Gates and Microsoft were ruthless in their pursuit of dominance in the personal computer industry. Their dream and vision was to put a personal computer on every desk running Microsoft software. To achieve it, they were willing and eager to crush the competition. Companies like Lotus, Novell and others had failed to halt the juggernaut and had been brought to their knees.

            </p><p>Microsoft’s strive for dominance was driven by fear and insecurity, not by arrogance, and Gates and his trusted team of lieutenants were determined to not let a startup do to them as they had done to other companies, large and small, and driven them almost out of business.

            </p><p>With the upcoming release of Windows 95, and their dominance in the PC industry, Microsoft felt invincible and weren’t going to let anyone take it from them.

            </p><p>In this landscape emerged Clark and Andreesen and their Browser, poised to take the world by storm. Netscape Communications was launched in Summer of 1994 and quickly became the fastest growing software company in the world. They were ruthless, arrogant and on a mission to take over the world. Their idea was to create a piece of software that would be so compelling and necessary that no one would be able to live without it. On October 13, 1994, Netscape Navigator hit the streets, promising to do just that. It was a runaway success. From this moment, conflict was inveitable between Microsoft and Netscape. The Internet age had begun, without Microsoft.

            </p><p>Microsoft had an advantage until now. The platform, the foundation on which all other software programs run and operate. The browser, besides being an enormously popular piece of software, also threatened to be the new platform upon which the civilization relied to connect to the Internet and conduct all their business.

            </p><p>Microsoft now realized its strategic blunder and set out to correct it, decisively. In his memo, titled the Internet Tidal Wave, Gates rallied his troops against Netscape and challenged them to build a rival that would “match and beat” the new rival. This was the beginning of the browser war.

            </p><p>By 1995, the Internet was a full-scale phenomenon with Netscape leading the charge. In a meeting in June 1995, Microsoft allegedly “offered” Netscape a one-time one-million-dollar fee to use their technology. The alternative was that they’d be run out of business. Netscape alerted the US Justice Department of Microsoft’s behavior as an violation of prevailing anti-trust laws and started laying the groundwork for a lawsuit against Microsoft.

            </p><p>Netscape soon went public with its IPO, and with the stock going through the roof, it ignited the rage that would soon lay the foundations of the dot-com boom. On the success of the IPO, Netscape felt invincible. Marc Andreesen’s constant derogatory comments towards Microsoft had the effect of spurring Microsoft on to take on Netscape and its primary product, the web browser. On December 7, 1995 Bill Gates declared that he had Netscape in his sights. Microsoft would develop a web browser of its own, the Internet Explorer.

            </p><p>All hands-on deck, all teams focused on one task, to destroy Netscape! The war was on! The sleeping giant had awaken. Microsoft’s plan was straightforward. Analyze Netscape’s every move and imitate it. Release version after version of IE and chip away at the head start garnerd by Navigator. In addition to the engineers working on IE, Microsoft also unleashed it’s army of Sales people to market it to every customer. The salesforce used all kinds of tactics, over and covert, to prevent PC manufacturers from installing anything other than IE. For example, they told Compaq that their Windows license was in jeopardy if they didn’t comply.

            </p><p>The results were indisputable. IE’s market share steadily grew. All this time, Microsoft held the trump card. Due to it’s significant cash reserves, they decided to give away IE for free, which Netscape couldn’t afford to with Navigator. By the time of IE version 4, Microsoft had captured 80% of all Internet users and the contest was effectively over. By September 1997, the browser war was over, Microsoft had won. Netscape was soon acquired by AOL.

            </p><p>Microsoft, though, didn’t get to rest on its laurels for long. In 1998, US Department of Justice, prodded by Microsoft’s enemies, launched an anti-trust lawsuit against them. The government accused Microsoft of using its Windows monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory and exclusionary business practices. By using Microsoft’s own exhibits against them, the government was able to prove its case. The judge agreed and recommended that the company be broken up. An Appeals court, while agreeing with the judgement, decided that the verdict was too harsh and rescinded the order to breakup the company.

             </p><p>Although Microsoft won the browser war, the revolution started by Netscape gave rise to a new world of startups like Google, Facebook, etc.</p>
